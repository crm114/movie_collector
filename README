= Movie Collector

Movie Collector gives people the ability to catalog their movies. You can enter film information manually, or simply enter a UPC code and let the app fill out the formation for you. Along with cataloging, you can loan your films out or borrow from another userâ€™s collection. Future enhancements will one day include viewing movies current out in the theater and their showtimes.
